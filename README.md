# projectOne

This project was designed to create a calculator application that is capable of addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

This code works well when doing simple mathematics but does have it's setbacks when it comes to aesthetic and actual use.

I created the code in a robust format that works well and compiles without error.

The most challenging part of the code to write was the functions that passed to other functions.

From this project, I can take away the necessary tools to create more advanced projects in the future. 

I made this project maintanable and also readable by creating code that functions as designed. 

Thank you.

Compile using gcc or g++.
